# chainshot-PoW-blockchain

This is a week-end project part of the Chainshot Ethereum Dev bootcamp

Working on this a I gained better understanding of the mining process in PoW blockchain, UTXOs and the utility of hashing algorithms + public/private key cryptography

### How to run

In the main project run "node index.js" to start the server.
Then run "node scripts/startMining.js" to start the miner on the server, and "node scripts/stopMining.js" to stop the miner.
